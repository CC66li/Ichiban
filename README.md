## Introduction
The Ichiban is the cooking and recipe generation based on the users' health conditions.
The system would restore the information of users, including the age, the height, the weight and the sex. Each usage would collect the food ingrediants and cookers then generate possible combinations of the meal with the calories suggestions. 


## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to select ingredients from categories like veggies, meat, staple
food, and kitchenware, so that I can generate a list of possible recipes based on my
preferences. I want to see a clear list of the generated recipes and easy access to the tutorials.
This will help me discover new meals that I can easily prepare with what I already have.
[Team Story]
- As a user, I want to be able to toggle between "strictly" and "loose" mode when generating
recipes. I want "strictly" mode to only show me recipes that include exactly the ingredients I
selected and "loose" mode to allow additional ingredients. This flexibility will help me
decide based on how closely I want to stick to the ingredients I have. [Zihan Guo]
- As a user, I want the website to remember my previous selections, so that I can quickly
regenerate recipes without having to re-select ingredients each time. I want to be able to
easily modify my selections from the last session to adjust based on what I have available.
[Yuqing Liu]
- As a user, I want the recipe generator to show me a preview of the recipe list before
committing to one. This will help me make an informed decision on which recipe is best
suited for my needs. [Yuxin Li]
- As a user, I want the website to recommend recipes that align with my dietary needs based on
my height and weight, calculating calories and basal metabolic rate to provide a tailored
menu. [Kai Huang]
