- As a user, I want to be able to select ingredients from categories like veggies, meat, staple
food, and kitchenware, so that I can generate a list of possible recipes based on my
preferences. I want to see a clear list of the generated recipes and easy access to the tutorials.
This will help me discover new meals that I can easily prepare with what I already have.
[Team Story]
- As a user, I want to be able to toggle between "strictly" and "loose" mode when generating
recipes. I want "strictly" mode to only show me recipes that include exactly the ingredients I
selected and "loose" mode to allow additional ingredients. This flexibility will help me
decide based on how closely I want to stick to the ingredients I have. [Zihan Guo]
- As a user, I want the website to remember my previous selections, so that I can quickly
regenerate recipes without having to re-select ingredients each time. I want to be able to
easily modify my selections from the last session to adjust based on what I have available.
[Yuqing Liu]
- As a user, I want the recipe generator to show me a preview of the recipe list before
committing to one. This will help me make an informed decision on which recipe is best
suited for my needs. [Yuxin Li]
- As a user, I want the website to recommend recipes that align with my dietary needs based on
my height and weight, calculating calories and basal metabolic rate to provide a tailored
menu. [Kai Huang]
